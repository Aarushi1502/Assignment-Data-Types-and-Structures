        "\n",
        "1.  What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "    - Data structures are organized ways to store and manage data for efficient access and modification. They are important because they optimize operations like searching, sorting, and data retrieval.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "    - Mutable: Can be modified after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",
        "          Example:lst = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "                  lst[0] = 10\n",
        "                  print(lst)\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Immutable: Cannot be modified after creation (e.g., strings, tuples).\n",
        "          Example:tup = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "                  tup[0] = 10  # Error: Tuples are immutable\n",
        "                \n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "      - Lists: Mutable, slower, use more memory.\n",
        "        Tuples: Immutable, faster, use less memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "      - Dictionaries use hash tables to store key-value pairs. Each key is hashed to find its corresponding value, enabling fast lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "      - Sets handle duplicate values automatically and offer faster membership testing (using the in keyword).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "      - A string is a sequence of characters that is immutable, whereas a list is a sequence of elements that is mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "    - Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be altered, ensuring the data remains consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "    - A hash table maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, allowing efficient key-based lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "      - Yes, lists can hold elements of different data types.\n",
        "            Example: mixed_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14]\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "    - Strings are immutable to ensure data integrity, optimize performance, and allow safe sharing across different parts of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "      - Dictionaries provide faster lookups for key-value pairs compared to lists, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "    - When the data should not be changed, such as storing coordinates or configuration settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "    - Sets automatically remove duplicate values.\n",
        "          Example: s = {1, 2, 2, 3}\n",
        "                   print(s)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the in keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - For lists, in checks if a value exists.\n",
        "                          \n",
        "      For dictionaries, in checks if a key exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "    - No, because tuples are immutable. Once created, their elements cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
        "    - A nested dictionary is a dictionary within another dictionary.\n",
        "          Example: students = {\n",
        "                             \"Alice\": {\"age\": 25, \"grade\": \"A\"},\n",
        "                             \"Bob\": {\"age\": 22, \"grade\": \"B\"}\n",
        "                              }\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "  - Accessing an element by key has an average time complexity of\n",
        "O(1).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "  - When order matters or the data is sequential and does not require key-based lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "  - Dictionaries do not maintain insertion order. Retrieval is based on keys, not sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "  - Lists retrieve elements by index, whereas dictionaries retrieve elements by key.\n",
